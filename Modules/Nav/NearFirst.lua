-- Near first: the route finishes what's around you before it sends you far.
--
-- The planner minimises sum(distance x weight). On its own a stop 2,000 yd
-- away and one 50 yd away cost the same per yard, so a tight cluster of kills
-- next to you can be split up by one far stop, or by an item drop whose mobs
-- are spread over the zone. Each time the route is planned, this scales a
-- stop's weight by how far it is from where you stand now:
--   * up to 300 yd away: unchanged
--   * beyond that: +1x per 700 yd more, at most 3x
--   * item-drop stops (kind "collect") not within 150 yd: another
--     1.5x. They are still planned (their quest can't be turned in without
--     them), just after the kills near you.
--   * milestones (class training, your mount) are left alone.
-- The planner re-plans as you move, so "near" always means near you. The
-- stops get their own weights back after each plan (their weight is set once
-- per collect, by the stop itself and the route objective in XpValue.lua).
--   /flow nearfirst on|off     (on by default)
