-- Druid class data shared by the spec, gear and (later) talent modules.
-- Roles map to the three colours used everywhere in Flow:
--   dps = red, heal = green, tank = blue
-- Levelling: a caster (Wrath, Moonfire) until Bear Form at 10, then Cat Form
-- at 20 does the killing. Feral covers both cat (dps) and bear (tank).
